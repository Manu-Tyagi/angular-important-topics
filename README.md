## What is the difference between AngularJS and Angular

* AngularJS
  * It is based on MVC architecture
  * It uses JavaScript to build the application
  * Based on controllers concept
  * No support for mobile platforms
  * Difficult to build SEO friendly application
* Angular
  * This is based on Service/Controller
  * Uses TypeScript to build the application
  * This is a component based UI approach
  * Fully supports mobile platforms
  * Ease to build SEO friendly applications


## Key Features of Angular

* Two way data binding
  * changes in model state are automatically reflected in the view and vice versa, without the need for manual DOM manipulation
* MVVM Architecture
  * follows model-view-view-model architecture pattern
  * model represents application data, view renders the user interface, view-model manages communication between the model and the view
* Depedency Injection
  * allows for the creation and injection of depedencies into component and services. making code more maintainable and scalable
* Directives
  * used to create reusable components, manipulate the DOM, add event handlers etc
* Components
  * encapsulate the application logic and UI into reusable and modular pieces
  * contains template
    * defines the view
  * contains class
    * contains the logic
* Routing
  * enables navigation between different views of an app without the need to reload the entire app
* Forms
  * Template driven
    * easy to use simpler forms
  * Reactive forms
    * more flexible, more control over validation
* HTTP Client
  * module for making ajax requests to server
  * provides features of request and response interceptions, error handling and support for observables for handling asynchronous data
* Modularity
  * promotes reusability, mantainability, scalability by separation concerns and encapsulating functionality
* Testing
  * built-in support for testing using tools like Jasmine and Karma.
  * provides utilities for writing unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, ensuring the reliability and stability of Angular application
